(Can be applied to multiple channels.)  It is highly suggested you do two things. \n\n> First run the command `!modonly echo`. \n\n> Then check your logs to see who was spamming the echo command. (If you don't have message logs setup, now is a good time to do this.)\n\n2. You have given webhook perms to a role in your server and it is being abused. This would post from an outside source to a specific channel to annoy you. [Webhooks Explained!](https://canary.discord.com/channels/186980582863929345/554783406890680331/735847442490327141)\n\n3. Dashboard Embed Builder is being used by a staff member who has Manage Server perms. \n\n4. Autoresponses (Triggers) have been setup by someone without your knowledge.
